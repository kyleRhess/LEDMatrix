# MicroMatrix (uMatrix)

#### uMatrix is an Arduino library for controlling a custom 16x8 LED matrix display.

\
This library uses the built-in SPI peripheral to communicate with a set of shift registers and the LED matrix. The existing library currently relies on custom hardware, but could be tailored to other designs.
